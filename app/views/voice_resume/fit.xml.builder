  xml.Say "Now to the most important question. Why is Amay fit for Twilio? Amay loves challenging environment and thrives in ambiguous situations. Having had his own startup, he has built his knowledge and tools around how to navigate these ambiguous situations, and use data to drive important decisions. He loves a fun environment and his co-workers term him as a fun person to work with. Amay has some recommendations for Twilio products that will make life easier for developers and would love to talk to you about his ideas. These are. Number 1. To provide a call simulation tool for developers, so that they don't have to keep calling their phones to test their applications. Number 2. To provide more detail regarding an application error when the developer tests his application by actually calling a phone number. Number 3. To study the most used case for Twilio API and build an application that moves Twilio towards end-point solution. Amay would love to implement these ideas that will be beneficial to Twilio community and clients. Amay looks forward to talking to the folks at Twilio soon."
